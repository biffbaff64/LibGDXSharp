This project is intended to be a C# conversion of the Java LibGDX Game Framework.

I have created files, many of which are essentially empty classes, for each file found in LibGDX.

The standard of the code here won't be great to start off with, but will hopefully improve as I
learn more about C#.

It may be that, as I get more familiar with C# and as the library progresses, some of these files
can be removed as they are already provided by C#.
Candidates for this may be:-
    - Array
    - StringBuilder
    - Json and Xml related classes
    - 

Classes need checking to see if any methods should be made virtual.
